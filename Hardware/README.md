This folder contains the Gerber file required to order the printed circuit board (PCB) for the HunStat2 potentiostat.
Additionally, two auxiliary files are provided for users who are less experienced with soldering small SMD components.
Using the BOM (Bill of Materials) and Pick-and-Place files, the HunStat2 can also be ordered as a fully assembled and pre-soldered board from most PCB manufacturing services.
