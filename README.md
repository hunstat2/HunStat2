## ðŸ§ª About HunStat2
**HunStat2** is a low-cost (~30 USD), open-source potentiostat capable of performing  
**cyclic voltammetry (CV)**, **open-circuit potential (OCP)** measurements, and **electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)**.  

The instrument is based on the **AD5941** analog front-end and a **Seeeduino XIAO RP2040** microcontroller, which together enable accurate DC and AC electrochemical techniques.  
The system supports EIS at the measured OCP potential and includes free, standalone Windows software for data acquisition and visualization.  

HunStat2 is designed for **analytical chemistry, electrochemical research, and education**, allowing researchers and students to perform reliable electrochemical experiments at minimal cost.
